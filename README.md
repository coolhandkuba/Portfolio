# homework2

This homework assignment is to make (3) .html files called "index", "portfolio", and "contact"

We are to utilize Bootstrap CSS to make the page responsive across all mobile devices. The website will be about me, Jakub Marchel, my understanding is that we will be updating the portfolio page with our projects as the class goes on.
